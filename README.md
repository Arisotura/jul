# jul

Jul is a fork of "Acmlmboard 1.92", an *ancient* system designed by Acmlm (not me). This repository is mostly kept so that improvements and updates are possible by forum members, and to patch any possible vulnerabilities. The actual running code itself includes a few protections that are not in this repository, mostly to prevent and guard against automated attacks.

The code is largely from 2005 and earlier, and has not seen major work in about as long. 


## installing
You are on your own for the time being. No default configuration or database dump is provided at this time.


## contributing

Pull requests are welcome, and are usually processed in a timely basis.


## license

This code is **not under a known license at this time**. That is not to say it is "free software" -- it is just not distributed under any license at the time being. In the future, maybe this will change.
